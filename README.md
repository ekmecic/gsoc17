# BeagleLibs GSoC '17
This repository contains read-only copies of the code as they stood at the GSoC '17 deadline.
Links to both of the main repositories where development will continue can be found below.

## Remaining work
The majority of the project goals were achieved.
All major components with the exception of the Go SPI and UART drivers were completed.
Aside from that, I will continue to work on improving the quality of documentation by adding more examples and improving the quality of the code.
