# `golibbeaglebone` &ensp;

`golibbeaglebone` is a WIP GO library that aims to provide a friendly interface for common embedded functionality for the BeagleBone family of devices.

## Features
golibbeaglebone will be feature-complete when the following interfaces are all implemented:
- [x] GPIO
- [x] PWM
- [x] ADC
- [ ] UART
- [ ] SPI
- [x] I2C

Note: `golibbeaglebone` is still in development meaning many of the features haven't yet been implemented.

```bash
go get github.com/ekmecic/golibbeaglebone
```
